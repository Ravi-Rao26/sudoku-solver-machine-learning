Application of Machine Learning in solving sudoku.
As a part of this project, Reinforcement Learning approach is explored in solving a sudoku puzzle. An article/post has been written so far which outlines the approach of implementing reinforcement learnng for sudoku. A code file has also been uploaded which illustrates convergence through application of code. 
The write up has been submitted as a paper to International Conference on Advanced Information Technologies and Applications https://icaita2020.org
